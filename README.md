# The shapes and shaping of consensus in online conversations

Large scale, pseudo-anonymous online discussion forums are now ubiquitous throughout society. They have also arguably become one of the most significant new forces of our time in both capturing and shaping mass public opinion. Many have been rightly concerned that these new spheres of public discourse bear some responsibility for the well-documented rise of political polarization and cross-group antipathy at the national level. In response to these concerns, a new field of "Civic Technology" has emerged with an aim of exploring how digital platforms might be designed to more actively foster civility and consensus in such discussions. 

To date, however, a systematic understanding of how different online discussion platforms capture the shape of existing opinion spaces or influence the very shaping of such spaces remains to be developed. This project will endeavor to begin addressing this gap by theorizing and empirically investigating how three different platforms affect the manner in which online discussions are generated from, and potentially reshape, the latent opinion space of participants.
